Just playing around with sockets from the socket package.

Added some functionalty including...

* Using Pug for templating
* Support for usernames
* Support for differently colored text
* Msg on log in and log out in chat
* Notifications of typing. 

Last time I messed around with sockets I was a bit confused but now expasions to the basic app make more sense.
