# 538 Alcohol Data Viz 

I recently finished Scott Murray's book on d3. Decided to do a simple project with a dataset I had on hand from [538](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/).
Rather simple, just a scatter plot that uses total drinks as the X axis, and beer, wine, and spirit servings as the y axis, with buttons to easily shift between
the various stats. 

There is also a slider to split the dataset based on total servings. 

I want to get better at d3, make nicer looking data viz, but this is a start...
